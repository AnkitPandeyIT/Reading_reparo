Mr. Hirsham B. Otis, an American minister, has just purchased the estate Canterville Chase from Lord Canterville. Canterville Chase, Lord Canterville explains, has been the home of the Canterville family for generations. He further informs Mr. Otis that the house comes fully furnished—but it also comes with a ghost that has haunted it for centuries, making all of the estate’s inhabitants most uncomfortable.

Mr. Otis laughs at Lord Canterville’s belief in haunting, saying that the Otis family comes from America, a modern country where no one believes in such things. If ghosts did exist, Mr. Otis says, Americans would have put one into a museum already. Despite Lord Canterville’s warnings, Mr. Otis goes through with the purchase.

At the end of the season, the Otis family moves into the home, including Mrs. Otis, the couple’s oldest son Washington, their daughter Miss Virginia E. Otis, and the twins, who are called affectionately “the Star and Stripes.” As they approach the house for the first time, the weather turns from a “lovely evening” into a gloomy storm. They’re met in the doorway by the housekeeper, Mrs. Umney, who is wearing a black dress.
