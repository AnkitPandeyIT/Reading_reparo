Mandy was lucky as she and her mother lived with her grandparents and she liked nothing better than to spend time with her grandfather.
You see, he was always making something and she enjoyed watching, learning, and sometimes even helping him finish whatever he was doing.

“Grandfather, what are you building in your workshop today?” Mandy asked. She giggled as she said, “It looks like you’re playing with two long sticks.” “Well Mandy,” he said. “I am going to make two walking sticks with your help, one for you, and one for me. Then I have a surprise.” “Alright!” Mandy shrieked. “Where do I start?” After some time, Mandy (with her grandfather’s help) finished the walking sticks. they were two of the most beautiful walking sticks she had ever seen.

With the bark removed, they were sandedsmoothand eachhad a funny looking face carved in them.“Theseare really nice,” Mandy said. “But just what dowe do with them?” “Ah, that is the surprisegranddaughter,”he replied.“Tomorrow morning we are going on a hike in the woods and these walking sticks will help make the hike easier.So now it’s time to clean up andgo to sleep so we are well rested for the hike.”

The next morning, Mandy did not need an alarm to wake her. She was up, dressed, and ready to go as the sun rose and the day began. She went to the kitchen and saw that her grandfather was busy packing sandwiches, water, snacks, and other items into their backpacks. “It looks like we are going
to be hiking for a long time,” Mandy said.

“It will be an all day hike,” He replied. “I think we have everything so grab your walking stick and let’s go.” 
“What about breakfast?” Mandy asked. “Oh, did I forget to mention that we are going to stop and have breakfast at a diner?” he said with a smile. Their journey began.
